# Ts Auto Mock ROADMAP

Here is a list of the feature we want to add to ts-auto-mock in 2020.

We cannot estimate how long it will take to develop these features because we work on it during our free time

- ## Always custom mock
Allow the creation of "persisted mocks". 

- ## Documentation for most useful framework/configuration
We are aware that configuring transformer is not an easy task.

That's why we want to provide a more useful documentation for each scenario
- React+jest
- Angular+jasmine
- Node+mocha
- ...

- ## Include framework wrappers (jest-ts-auto-mock, jasmine-ts-auto-mock) into ts-auto-mock
To make sure that any changes on ts-auto-mock will keep working on any framework we will include the wrapper libraries inside ts-auto-mock.

This will also help us to publish new version of framework wrappers easily when there is a new version of ts-auto-mock

- ## Run mock test on typescript Definitely type overnight
This is a really important feature that will allow us to find bugs quicker than waiting for people to try the library.

Definitely type contains many types that we can use to make sure that we are supporting mostly of typescript features

- ## Performance analytics
We want to make sure that ts-auto-mock is not impacting the compilation of your code too much.
Creating performance analytics on each build will show us if any particular new feature its increasing the compilation time.

It will also allow us to improve performance

- ## Write articles about react, angular, vuejs etc
We truly believe that ts-auto-mock has a lot of potential but we need to increase our exposure on the web to make sure people start using it
