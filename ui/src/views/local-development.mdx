# Local development

If you want to add a new functionality of fix a bug in ts-auto-mock you are in the right place

## Pre requisite
- node >= 10
- npm
- the repo cloned locally

## Install local dependencies
- Make sure you are in the root folder
- run npm install
```
npm install
```

## Build the transformer
- run npm run build
```
npm run build
```

## Make a change
Ts auto mock has multiple modules, each of them has a different meaning and depending of what you are editing you can just re build the specific one
- transformer
- repository
- extension
- merge

If you are editing the transformer

```
npm run build:transformer
```

If you are editing anything else
```
npm run build:modules
```

## Test your changes
There are 2 ways to test the effectiveness of your changes
- Use the existing test system
    - add a test
    - run all the tests
    ```
        npm run test
        // use npm run test:transformer if you are just editing the transformer
    ```
- use the Playground
    - open the file [playground.test.ts](https://github.com/Typescript-TDD/ts-auto-mock/blob/master/test/playground/playground.test.ts)
    - make your changes
    - run test playground to see the test passing
    ```
    npm run test:playground
    ```
    - run build playground to see the output of the generate code
    ```
    npm run build:playground
    ```

That's it.
