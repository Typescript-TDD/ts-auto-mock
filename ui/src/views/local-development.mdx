# Local development

If you want to add new functionality or fix a bug in `ts-auto-mock` you are in the right place.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 10
- NPM
- A local clone of the repo

## Install local dependencies

Make sure you are in the project root folder

```
npm install
```

## Build the transformer

```
npm run build
```

## Make a change
`ts-auto-mock` consists of multiple modules, each of them has a different meaning and depending on what you are editing you can re-build each module individually

- `transformer`
- `repository`
- `extension`
- `merge`

If you are editing the transformer:

```
npm run build:transformer
```

If you are editing anything else:
```
npm run build:modules
```

## Test your changes
There are 2 ways to test the effect of your changes

- Use the existing test system
    - Add a test
    - Run all the tests

    ```
    npm run test
    // or use npm run test:transformer if you are just editing the transformer
    ```

- Use the playground
    - Open the file [playground.test.ts](https://github.com/Typescript-TDD/ts-auto-mock/blob/master/test/playground/playground.test.ts)
    - Make your changes
    - Run test playground to see the test pass

    ```
    npm run test:playground
    ```

    - Run build playground to see the emitted JS code in the corresponding `playground.test.js`-file
    ```
    npm run build:playground
    ```

That's it.
