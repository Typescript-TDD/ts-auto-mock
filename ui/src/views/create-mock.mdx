# Create mock
```ts
import { createMock } from 'ts-auto-mock';

interface Person {
  id: string;
  getName(): string;
  details: {
      phone: number
  }
}
const mock = createMock<Person>();
mock.id // ""
mock.getName() // ""
mock.details // { phone: 0 }
```

## Property overrides

If you desire, you may override the otherwise mocked properties of an interface.

You don't have to provide the entire interface, just a partial object of the one you are mocking.

```ts
import { createMock } from 'ts-auto-mock';

interface Person {
  id: string;
  getName(): string;
  details: {
    phone: number
  }
}

const mock = createMock<Person>({
    details: {
      phone: 7423232323
    }
});

mock.id // ""
mock.getName() // ""
mock.details // { phone: 7423232323 }
```

### Override with created mock as value
If a mock is used as a value in the override object the mock will be entirely assigned and not merged. This is done to
avoid issues with recursive mocks. Surely this won't be a problem for anyone but it's worth writing it in the documentation.
```ts
import { createMock } from 'ts-auto-mock';

interface Person {
  id: string;
}

interface PersonParent {
  child: Person;
}

const personMock = createMock<Person>();
const parentMock = createMock<PersonParent>({
    child: personMock
});

parentMock.child === personMock // true

const personMock2 = createMock<Person>();
delete personMock2.id;
const parentMock2 = createMock<PersonParent>({
    child: personMock2
});

parentMock2.child === personMock2 // true
parentMock2.child.id // undefined, even if `id` was not in the override object (personMock2) it still did override
                     // because the entire `personMock2` was assigned to `child`
```
