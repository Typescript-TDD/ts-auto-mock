# Create hydrated mock

Do you need to mock **optional** properties or union types that may be undefined? <br/>
Say hello to **createHydratedMock**, it will help you create mocks that will treat optional interfaces as they were not optional

We currently support optional token (?) and union types that contains undefined.

## Optional interfaces

```ts
import { createHydratedMock } from 'ts-auto-mock';

interface Person {
  id?: string;
  details?: {
      phone?: number
  }
}
const mock = createHydratedMock<Person>();
mock.id // ""
mock.details // { phone: 0 }
```

## Union types

```ts
import { createHydratedMock } from 'ts-auto-mock';

interface Person {
  getName(): string | undefined;
  getSurname(): undefined | string;
}
const mock = createHydratedMock<Person>();
mock.getName() // ''
mock.getSurname() // ''
```

## Note from the team

We completely understand the need of this functionality, but we would like the usage to be much simpler.  <br/>
We would like to use the existing createMock in combination of typescript Required interface

```ts
import { createMock } from 'ts-auto-mock';

interface Person {
  id?: string;
}
type Required<T> = { // from typescript lib
    [P in keyof T]-?: T[P];
};
const mock = createMock<Required<Person>>();
mock.id // ""
```

Unfortunately this doesn't work because we don't fully support map types.
