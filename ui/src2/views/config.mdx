## debug
We currently support
- Logs for [not supported types](./types-not-supported)
It will log any  not supported type automatically converted to null.
This is useful to report an issue or to investigate a potential bug

## cacheBetweenTests
One of the main functionality of ts auto mock is to generate mocks and cache them.

Mocks are currently created in the test file making tests to depend to each other

Example:
- test1.test.ts has a createMock of Interface.
- test2.test.ts has a createMock of Interface.
- test1.test.ts will have the registration of Interface mock
- test2.test.ts will have a registration import.

If test2 run in a different context than test1 it will not be able to access to the same mock.

Set this property to false when your test run in different context.

We are working on an [issue](https://github.com/Typescript-TDD/ts-auto-mock/issues/101) to make sure tests do not depend to each other but they will still take advance of a cache system
